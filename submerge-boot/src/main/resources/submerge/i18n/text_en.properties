subcli.basicUse = Installation
subcli.basicUse.intro = submerge-cli is a command line application with the exact same features as the website. The main functionnality is  to merge two subtitles into one ASS displaying both, but it can also be used to convert SRT to ASS, ASS to SRT  or to change the encoding of a file.
subcli.basicUse.jre.message = The application is developed in java. So it can be used on linux / Mac / Windows but require to install 
subcli.basicUse.jre.link = Java Runtime Environment 8
subcli.basicUse.jre.version.windows = To find which version of Java is installed on your computer (windows) :
subcli.basicUse.jre.version.linux = On linux :
subcli.basicUse.jre.version.go = If the java version number is lower than 8, you will need to update it. The use of submerge-cli does not require any other manipulation, you can open a terminal in the same folder as the jar and execute the desired command lines. For instance to print the help :
subcli.basicUse.linux.command = To run the jar file in a linux command line (linux), create a file stub.sh in the same directory as the jar and paste the following code :
subcli.basicUse.createStub = Then execute :
subcli.basicUse.example = Submerge can now be run like any other linux command :
subcli.merge = Merge
subcli.merge.intro = The merge command inputs 2 subtitles (ASS or SRT) and generate a ASS file in the current directory. To customize the generated subtitle, see the "configuration" tab.
subcli.merge.optionOutput = The target filename can ne set with --output
subcli.merge.shortOptions = Each option can be reduced to its first letter :
subcli.srt = SRT
subcli.srt.intro = The srt command inputs 2 subtitles (ASS or SRT) and generate a SRT file in the current directory.
subcli.srt.optionOutput = The target filename can ne set with --output
subcli.srt.shortOptions = Each option can be reduced to its first letter :
subcli.ass = ASS
subcli.ass.intro = The ass inputs 2 subtitles (ASS or SRT) and generate a ASS file in the current directory. To customize the generated subtitle, see the "configuration" tab.
subcli.ass.optionOutput = The target filename can ne set with --output
subcli.ass.shortOptions = Each option can be reduced to its first letter :
subcli.utf8 = UTF-8	
subcli.utf8.intro = The utf8 command inputs any file (without format restrinction), guess the encoding and convert its content to UTF-8.
subcli.utf8.optionOutput = Without other options, this command overwrite the inputed file. The target filename can ne set with --output
subcli.utf8.shortOptions = Each option can be reduced to its first letter :
subcli.config = Configuration
subcli.config.intro = Comme le site, submerge-cli permet de configurer les param\u00e8tres les plus courants du fichier ASS g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 : couleur, police, taille et contour. Le param\u00e9trage se fait dans un fichier de configuration XML situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du jar.
subcli.config.unzip = Pour le modifier, il faut donc ouvrir le jar avec un gestionnaire d'archive et modifier le fichier user-config.xml :
subcli.config.xmlfile = Celui-ci se pr\u00e9sente comme suit :
subcli.config.howtoxml = Le bloc dualAssConfig configure les param\u00e8tres utilis\u00e9s par la commande --merge tandis que le bloc simpleAssConfig configure ceux de la commande --ass. Pour chacun la configuration est similaire et les valeurs possibles de chacune des balise sont les m\u00eames que sur le site (attention \u00e0 la police qui doit respecter la casse).
